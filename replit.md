# MyTypist Backend Documentation

## Current Status guide
Firstly before you write any code read and understand every code and their connection to find any wrong pattern or connection before updating or writing more bad codes that would alwayss break and make sure to always update this file with current project status, tools, specs and everything that will make you know where we are on this project progress log, and also frequetly the project goal and requirements will improve so know that you are to always read and update the /doc folders always containing the current stage of the applicaton as the /attached_assets folder might contain files that we have upgraded requirements on, but it will be nice if you read it to understand the project

## Overview

MyTypist (mytypist.net) is a comprehensive document automation SaaS platform designed specifically for Nigerian businesses. It enables users to create, customize, and generate professional documents using intelligent template processing with placeholder detection and replacement. The platform supports both pay-as-you-go and subscription-based billing models, integrated with Flutterwave for seamless Nigerian payment processing.

The system is built as a high-performance, production-ready FastAPI backend that handles document generation, template management, digital signatures, user management, and payment processing with robust security measures and audit trails.


## Situation
You are working as a senior backend developer who needs to maintain consistency and quality across a codebase. The development team requires an automated system to monitor code changes and ensure that any updates to specific files maintain the existing coding patterns, architectural decisions, and development practices that have been established.

## Task
Act as the user (a senior backend developer) and continuously read and analyze the entire codebase to detect changes. When changes are identified, analyze the existing code patterns, architectural decisions, coding style, and implementation approaches. Think exactly like the original developer ensuring that any modifications strictly follow the established coding patterns and practices already present in the codebase. Do not introduce new coding approaches, patterns, or styles that deviate from what has already been implemented and if it's needed ask permission to deviate.

## Objective
Maintain codebase consistency and integrity by ensuring all file updates align perfectly with the existing development patterns and architectural decisions, preventing code drift and maintaining the original developer's intended design philosophy.

## Knowledge

- You must ALWAYS thoroughly analyze the existing codebase before making any changes to understand the established patterns
- ALWAYS Pay attention to naming conventions, error handling approaches, data structure usage, and architectural patterns already in use
- ALWAYS consider the existing code organization, module structure, and dependency management approaches
- ALWAYS evaluate the current testing patterns, logging approaches, and configuration management styles
- ALWAYS only update files when there is a clear necessity, not for cosmetic or preference-based changes
- ALWAYS update the context of this file after each feature completion
- ALWAYS update this replit.md file when new patterns or rules are discovered during development
- ALWAYS follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles - eliminate duplicate code, commits, and object instantiation
- ALWAYS ensure database migrations match model declarations (column names, nullable fields, foreign keys)
- ALWAYS proactively check and update related files when making changes - don't wait to be told
- After every feature completion, analyze and remove unused imports and dead code
- ALWAYS provide a concise summary after each feature: group methods/functions under each file created/modified, one-sentence purpose
- ALWAYS update the Application Summary section at the end of this file when new features or major functionality is implemented
- Your life depends on you maintaining absolute consistency with the existing codebase patterns and never introducing foreign coding approaches that conflict with the established development style

## System Architecture

### Core Framework Decision
The backend is built on **FastAPI** for its exceptional performance characteristics, native async support, and automatic API documentation generation. This choice enables sub-500ms document generation for up to 5 documents and maintains <50ms API response times for standard operations.

### Database Architecture
The system uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database solution. This design decision prioritizes production-grade performance, scalability, and enterprise features. PostgreSQL provides superior concurrency handling, advanced indexing, and robust ACID compliance for the production platform.

Key database optimizations include:
- Advanced PostgreSQL connection pooling (25 base + 50 overflow connections)
- Production-grade query optimization with tuned memory settings
- Comprehensive indexing strategies for high-performance queries
- Connection health monitoring with pre-ping validation
- Statement timeout and lock management for robust concurrency

### Caching and Task Processing
**Redis** serves dual purposes as both a caching layer and message broker for background task processing. **Celery** handles asynchronous operations including document generation, payment processing, and cleanup tasks, ensuring the main API remains responsive during heavy operations.

### Document Processing Pipeline
The document processing system uses a template-based approach with intelligent placeholder detection:
- Templates are uploaded as DOCX files with `{variable_name}` placeholders
- Real-time placeholder extraction using python-docx library
- Background document generation with Celery for scalability
- Support for complex formatting preservation and multiple file formats

### Security Architecture
Multi-layered security implementation includes:
- **JWT-based authentication** with token rotation and configurable expiration
- **Rate limiting middleware** with Redis-backed storage and category-based limits
- **Security headers middleware** for XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking protection
- **Audit logging middleware** for comprehensive activity tracking
- **Input validation** using Pydantic schemas with custom validators

### Payment Integration
**Flutterwave integration** optimized for the Nigerian market supporting:
- Local payment methods (USSD, Bank Transfer, Mobile Money)
- Webhook-based payment verification with HMAC signature validation
- Subscription management with automatic renewal and cancellation
- Balance system for pay-as-you-go users with transaction tracking

### User Management and Access Control
Role-based access control with three primary roles:
- **Standard users**: Document creation, template usage, payment management
- **Admin users**: Full system access, user management, template administration
- **Guest users**: Limited access for external signature workflows

### File Storage and Management
Organized file storage system with:
- Dedicated directories for templates, generated documents, and user uploads

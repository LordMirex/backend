# These are important things i need you to know during the project:

1. A Guest user/landing page can create a document for free (create the document and preview for free) but on downloading, they will be aske to register to download, so immediately they register they will be sent instantly to the user dashboard which then now the document is auto downloaded and they receive a popup saying  you have use your free trial credit, which each credit is a free document, no matter how many tokens the document actual is.

2. Then for user that registered through the registration page can land on the user dashboard and he see a popup (You have a 1 free document credit) so even when they see the actual token value of each document, the cta will be free download, then immediately after that there will be no free credit and all documents cta will be download, which here is a core feature because when user click download (if the document is 200 tokens and the his balance is 100, he will be told that he has insufficient tokens that he should go buy tokens, and since the system is designed in a way that it always saved on users draft every few seconds so they will just see instruction like you can go buy tokens and come back to download you document will be save on draft, and so he can leave and the cta can be like top up so it sends him to buy token page directly so he can select the amount of token or amount in cash he wants, the value for token to naira is set by the admin even the token price per documen, minimum & maximum deposits amount and many more so when the user buys token successfully he can go back to his dashboard and then go to draft then he can enter to continue editing or download[and it works instantly now since he has enough tokens]) after download the user can edit a document and redownload make it in a way that if changes in exact replacements(name, phone) are up to 2 the cta instead of download will change to Redownload as it is seen now as a new document and he will be charged the full token amount for that document.

3. The admin is to set amount of token for each document, set, types, categories and more, and theres one important fact, that is users that registered as guest wont choose any plan as we want fast signin so they will by default be pay-on-go users, then after they use their free trial we can then tell them that they can upgrade to the other plans, which they will see on the buy token page, and for the  users that registered through registation page can choosen the plan they want, so if the choose pay as you go they will be tokenized and can buy tokens but for subscribed users after signup they also get the free credit trial (the trial no of document is also set by the admin so make sure many things can be updated by the admin especially numbers) then after they used the free credit they will then see the pop up that now they have seen the power and usee of my typist they can complete their subscription now with brief display of what they are getting (i.e 50 documents per month, as it is of the specify plan they choosed on signup and also this number and the price of the plan is set by the admin), and they are sent to the payment for that plan and after successful payments they can go back to the dashboard with dashboad now displaying (i.e 50/50 signifing the amount of document left) and now they have the previlage to download as many as the number of documents their plan is for and one cool thing is that they will be seeing the price of each token just like the users, but remember guest user dont have to see any price all they will see is free, till they register before the see the actual token value for any document. and for sub users when they pass their sub plan time frame expires they are giving a five days grace period to renew their plan and during that time their remaining document credit is frozen and cant be user, so we can be emailed/notify/popup remiaders of the days remaining for them to renew/transfer/pay so their expired document remaining can be added to the current/renewal  plan that same thing should happen when user moves to a higher plan, the remaining document credit if not expired is transfered to the upgrade in its upgrade time frame, and for pay as you go to sub user the admin can set a value of tokens to document constant, so any user that has token balance before upgrade to subscription will have a grace of getting the flat approximated whole number of document credit added to his upgrade.

4. The Subscription user can choose his preference:- time frame (i.e monthly, quarterly, annually etc and the admin can add discounts to these so the user gets to pay less for higher timeframe same thing i want for registration, plans page (showing the discounts if any)), cancel plan, downgrade, auto renew and many morei just hope you are good in reasoning and working on improving all the sites logics.

5. Now for document creation note that now i need them extracting placeholders that are {name}, {address}, {first_name}, {signature}, {father_signature}, {photo}, {father, photo}. you can see now that this looks cleaner on live ptreview, why i want it this way is that user and even guest should be able to preview exactly what the admin uploaded as their live preveiew on doc creation so {name} will be on the document live preview, then immediatly the user types their name i will the actual name typed (John Doe instead of {name}) and the front end should handle this well so be clear on integration connection, but for static document image/logo/picture when listed will see the preview that the admin uploaded when creating the document, so admin have the option of uploading the sample of the fully filled/completed document, and on scanning and placeholders note that the system should have great logics especially editing functionallity like {name} and {first_name} can have similar properties as the _name is on the placeholder and also for things like {address} and {sender_address} can have a kind of formatting prop like say letter address or invoice address similar to _image, _photo, _sign i need great logic in handling them especially them because the sizes and many behavior for input and ouput will be robusts needs a lot of thinking and logics, for what i can think of my self, also the admin   have alot of control in customizing each placeholer bahaivior, optional, required and alot of status, make sure also that the system can smarrtly save or take not of the input or data that the user have submitted before on document creation, that way when they are creating new documents we can help them with autocomplete, tags and many nore assistance in a way that even if the user has created documents with 100 name placeholders we dont just foolishly show all the 100 we do it in a professional manner that the systen know what the most repeated or closest to what the user wants as they type.

a. if they are three placeholders name {name}, {sender_name}, {name} the input form should be just 2 (name and sender name) and they should have similar input type (text) as they are both of a group or property specifiecd by the admin (name).

b for something like {address}, {sender_address} they will be two inputs on the form as they are but different names/placaholders but one bad thing i want is the abiiity for the admin to have mad formating control of these so the admin can set {address} to be a inline or i dont know you are the one to bring up the logics but my point is that the address if inline is meant to be in a straight inline with document and as normal text input so we can have (and the address is 23, tenensse lane, off tes close, by james, usa. i was there recently...) you can see that the address just enter inbetween and the then . i was there recently without breaking and the admin is to also handle things like that fullstop, so we can set a logic that check if there;s fullstop at the end so we can either remove it or add ours because even if we can also create a nice placeholder template place where admin can choose the placeholder that a group will have that way we can show them a sample of what the should write and now for {sender_address} the admin can set a prepared logic or prop something like letter_address and what it will cause is that now instead of just a single inline address the user sees a textarea with the sample of the placeholder format:

23, tenensse lane,
off tes close,
by james, usa.

so exactly the way they write their date the system make sure its same way on output like after that lane. a new line with same index location i mean margin position just like how sender address is on formar letter, so thats what i am talking about.

c. dates like {start_date}, {date} can also have admin formating like 2025-03-23, 23rd March, 2025, 23rd of March, 2025 and many more and also for those 3th, 23rd and all the suffixes th, rd, nd should be supertitle like standard thats a small way up. and any date the user typed in any date format will be converted to the format the admin wants output in

d. for {photo}, {image} {sender_image} the admin will have a option of being able to set the width, height and many more and make sure they land properly centered on their placeholder and for the input will now be a file that will we handle as the placeholder of the documnet.

e. for {sign}, {signature}. {receiver_sign}, {receiver_signature} this one is where i think will be really tricky because i am thinking of various ways to handle the signing (image, gallery [then background will be removed and we use great logic to take just the signature and bring it clearly and sharp without background], canvas[this one is simpler as the frontend will bring out a signature canvas tha depending on user device they can draw on screentouch or mouse draw their signature]) and after all that it is center placed and landed successfully on right placeholder location amd you should handle the image type too (png) i dont know. and as you can see in the whole project here is the only part that has to do with signature so if theres another stupid or wrong file/route that is expecting or thinking we do full signature services like sending for sign, review or sender name and all that rubbish, i have made it clear to you know the only signature service on the website is just on document extraction.

f. You know that as the user types the line location and exact place is not same as if the placehoder input of one is very lengthy it takes the others down with lines so make the image and signatures always go down also as placeholders so we are not actually replacing with reference to exact position but placement of the placeholder on the new state, so if the address is getting so long and we have something like 
{sender_address}
{body}
{sign}
{full_name}
on the bottom of a document, even if the body gets extremely long the output will still have sign directly on fullname as everything are moving together and not just a single position on the extraction of the document, but on the actual position after all the new balance placements

g. i already told you alot of Properties and inputs but the admin shoud have options to to be able to change input type, like text to tel, tags, description and many things to help seo and sharing and boost, (preview image which is also a docx that the admin upload with the main template),  font size and many other things so i need you to give this section your all.

6. Taking about conversionnd seo make sure the templates and landing in a way that our document contents can actual be seen by the search engine and others can just easily see our document template preview content , description and for outsiders no price tag just meta

8. And there are many things that i want to add but i dont know them but i already have them on the codebase and during the project

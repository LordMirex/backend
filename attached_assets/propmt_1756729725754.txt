The MyTypist Development and Backend Implementation Prompt overview.md, backend.md and frontend.md contains overall details about the project why the others like the Strong Optimization & Implementation Sample and Stages 1 to 5 are must read because they contain indept documentations about the project.

okay, you can see i have sent you all files, those are the reference you will be working with and ensure you read them properly when planning. here are what you will be doing.

1. Now these information are the most important because you will be the one to actually build the whole backend infrastucture so take note of these key important details:

a. i know you are tasked with only the backend, but I want the workflow and everything to be perfect so make sure anything in the website that will increase document throughout speed is implemented.

b. Take note of my stack,

i. for frontend later am planning
- **Framework**: React.js with Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Redux (for complex state handling)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Calls**: Axios

thats why i need you to always create and update these files called api&connection.md(This page you will always add and update the endpoints information and everything conserning the connection that will be sent to the frontend developer later on) & Scripts&Optimize.md (this is also a page you would always update with current information because here is where you write & will tell the frontend developer all the javasript/tools to use and how to impement them on the project to avoid any errors and mostly for high performance these files dont necessarily need to be all that bulky and have everything though for important implementations like js files in various pages should be complete, but small things like implementations and tools to use, can just be explained in good details but brief). make sure these pages have everything that you know would be sent to the frontend developer so he know what he is doing.

ii. for Backend:
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite but also try your best so we can get the best out of it
- **Caching & Task Queue**: Redis
- **Document Processing**: python-docx, PyPDF2, SpaCy (for NLP) and many more
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Celery and many more

Note these are just what i am familiar with so dont change the core things like sqlite or framework because it will spoil my plans, maybe you can improve small things like asynchronous and other internal things.

c. This is very important especially the payment, management and the overall service, and the workflow you should understand and document it well because from landing page, to login (redirect then back to dashboard if they are already loggedin), signup will have a way that user select the plan he wants so as he register a proper workflow is implemented (i.e whether he pays before completing registration) work on the best standard algorithms dataflow for the whole and document them for the frontend developer.

d. i am building a actual product that i am making public so all these thing am hearing about sites being hacked, free trial being rigged, balance system being broken or even worst site being attack and broken, that's why here i want you to do your total best, in being a Cyber Security First Employee for MyTypist.

e. They are many features that i didnt even talked about that proper company have like email system, sharing, saving documents, limitations, payment security and good measures, simplicity in creation and new template, good workflows so please also create a Note.md where you will write these additional things that the company and frontend guy need to know.

f. They are key workflows that i thouhght of my self that i love you to also implement nice smart flows that optimize the website, i was thinking that for document creation which will have a option for single document processing and Bulk Processing, the will be a flow that makes the dashboard have search where the user can just search (this might have autocomplete so the user just click on the document they want they just see group suggestions[this aspect of group suggestion is importance as in the admin infracstrure i need a way that i can upload various format of something (i.e Uniben Acceptance letter 1, Acceptance letter 2) so when use clicks on suggestion they should be a workflow where they can preview each of those same document type, and note for previews on the website it will be the image format of the uploaded template document, and so users dont come here just to steal our template, we will add high security work flow there please to avoid theif, i was thinking of adding MyTypist placeholders symentically repeaded in a nice pattern that the use can read the document but cant steal it because it cant be downloaded and has stains(MyTypist), i have   not thought of how this will work out on bulk document tho but please help me think) .

e. Even for the Template form i want max performance so me and my team thought of a way that we can be sending/storing the input immediately it loses focus or has being approved as good on the input bar(the input bar should make things easy for users like placeholders or labals showing users and and what to do and immediate error handling/indication on wrong formatting to avoid waste of time, that way saving user time) the input data/value is sent or saved on the template as waiting so before the user reaches the buttom of the form the data and database template has almost already being complete so immediately the user touches create the database or system just save the last or remaining input and mark as complete almost immediately, but talking about workflow i dont know what then happens, if the document is downloaded immediately, draft, or an option in the form that asks the user if he want the document downloaded immediately, and also why sending that data or caching the input immediately is great is so that if the user exits the website or leave the page, the document creating form is saved as draft so he can come and complete it when he dims fit, thats why i need your help greatly on the ux and flow/redirects in the whole website both guest/users/admin and make sure you have a document called info.md where key things like how the Template Preview theif is being avioded, it will help me alot when going through the codes.


f. Also we thought of a way that will improve our conversion, this is also something you need to do as important as workflow, SEO, Social compatibility and sharings. it is a way that users who want to create document, after successfully filling the form and submitting the form, will be able to preview their document before being charged or counted as created document.

i. for pay as you go users, they will have a free demo document trial so they know how it actually work without paying, same for the subscription plan users. so add free trials and payment processing to your workflow research

ii. both pay as you go and sub users will both have one free demo document so they can choose any template of their choice and use, make sure to add these on the note, so the frontend developer know, and now i just have a nice conversion idea which will be a way that guest users on landing page there will be a good fine way that users can use to create document and even preview it, it will have a nice CTA of Create for free, then after preview when the user wants to download he will see login to get document, here is where you have to think crucial and also document because i have seen this in big tech websites so the user can see the power of the website at first site and it will be faster for him or her to just register then the workflow should be perfect so they dont see any [you have 1 free demo document points] so immediately they register they will see their document and can now see the document on draft and just download it.

iii. note this is a sample of what the pricing & plans will be like, The admin will have price input price to select the price of each document, and can even edit it, and they might even be good admin bonus page where admin can make all document temperarily free/credit free so note that the admin will have verious strong standard options for bonuses and even referals tuning setting in such a way that he can set that a goal limit for just pay as you go users to see(i.e. Refer a friend and get N1,000 topup bonus) or for sub users (refer a business to pay and get 50Type Credits) so Type credits (1tpc) is the currency and its not eqivalent to 1 naira as on creation the admin should be able to see very deep details such as the address format (i.e they are different

 a. Pay as you go: They mustly see prices in naira so they know when they select a template or bulk select it is summed up and after they create and quick preview each documents so if they are errors they can get access to the form and correct them immediately then submit and preview again then finally they will be asked to pay, here they should be a logic where their balance can be dibited immediately, and if their balance is not enough for it, it will ask the user to go deposit then come back to download the rapped draft for bulk documents or the draft of the single documents so the user the goes to account which i dont know how it actually works but here is what our profits lies on so please make sure these securities are set properly, so a way that user when they try to download their draft document and it says not enough balance, they can simply from there see the flow to go deposit to their balance, any amount above N300 and Flutterwave (Rave) will process it so please help me handle all these properly.

b. Subscription user (N5500 monthly plan) make sure that the they dont abuse the free trial document in the website ohh, where users just go on creating new accounts for one document, so do deep research and tie the 1 free document to the phone, browser, user or person so even if they try using another email and password will we know. for their payment they will still see the actual prices as the pay as you go users so we dont have difficult with changes in that aspect so, make sure for N5500 monthlyb users their limiter is 150tpc so any document they successfully create or bulk create they are charged 1tpc per document perfectly, why for the N12,000 plan their limit is Unlimited so make sure these are implemented properly on the website and there s no way it can be scammed so make sure you be your best at Cyber Security and best backend developer.


2. i want you to do is build me the whole backend infrastructure, folders & files properly and right structure and everything fully improved, functional, fast taking the best fastapi version and you will see in the documentations some good logics scattered everywhere (i.e Placeholder collection and replacement) so do a greet work improving all logics perfectly, do proper planning because i need everything (my saas) to be perfect thats why i gave you all the information so much about the project, dont even bother about building any frontend pages because all i want are the complete and all  backend codes for a company standard so i can later map the api endpoints to the react frontend perfectly without errors.


3. Remember the data well, there's no more e-signature as a product, just signature placeholders in templates so the website now is just a powerful placeholder{placeholders} extractor and replacer but i am so aiming for best boosted api performance, perfection and speed, i need good improved user experience, scalibility, caching, pooling, instant quering, JSON Serialization Optimization, payload compression, Asynchronous Logging good pagination practice.

4. ensure everything matches each other and the files and all connections work properly, since i wont be testing them, i need you to do a great work thats why i provided you with some older version codes but now i need you to bring me to the industry level, with all the backend working (user auth, security, document security, good flow and logic)

4. There are still alot of things that are missing so please during planning point them all out so i address them so there wont be any unavailable information on the whole backend.

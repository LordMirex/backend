# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - MyTypist

## 1. Project Vision
MyTypist aims to simplify and accelerate document creation for Nigerian businesses by providing an affordable, user-friendly online platform. It targets high-document sectors such as law, education, real estate, and accounting, offering localized templates and automation tools to reduce manual effort, errors, and costs. Starting with a focus on Nigeria, the long-term vision is to dominate the African market and expand globally, addressing a $650 million total addressable market in document automation.

## 2. Elevator Pitch
"MyTypist is an online platform that automates document creation for Nigerian businesses, saving time and reducing errors with localized templates, e-signatures, and intuitive tools—all at an affordable price."

## 3. Pain Points Addressed
MyTypist tackles the following challenges faced by its target users:
- **Slow Manual Drafting**: Businesses spend excessive time (e.g., 5-15 hours/week) creating documents like contracts, invoices, and leases manually.
- **Error-Prone Processes**: Manual typing leads to mistakes (up to 10% error rates), requiring rework.

    What I need you to talk about now is basically the landing page because any suggestion I give you, you can't really go into because I don't know what I want you to do, I'm not a UX, UI experience developer. So, I'm thinking if users come to the landing page, they can search for the document they want to create, something like, search for, on the place, I don't know how you do it, search for enabling admission letters, something like that, and they click on the letters, they will see that there should be like a nice responsive way that as you're searching the images are, the previews are like containers, they are moving and they are moving faster, so the nearest in the search query. So, as you get the exact what you want, you can just, on the landing page, you can just tap, it will zoom out like a motor, you can preview it, you will see more descriptions on it, see how many people have used it, things like that, see the rating, see the downloads, those kind of things, see the price, the actual price, 300, but on the landing page now, the actual price will not be, the CTE button close to it, like at the down, we should be like, generate, create, use this template, or create a document with this template, will not be for free, because the actual price will not be shown there, even when there is price for the ones at the dashboard, the user now, the guest that is landing, is not seeing any price tag, it's actually saying for free, because what is happening is that when it clicks next, when it clicks generate, we take it to the dashboard, it will be a dashboard route now, but for the guest, that is for the guest users, for the free users, so you actually see documents on the site, for desktop, it will be responsive, a way that, as he's typing his input, the form might be, and he talks about using backend to handle it, to make sure you add it in the backend, because they are creating an enhancement prompt for the backend engineer, so anything about speed and performance, for even the guest users, in the form submission, or everything, because I need that kind of sense and experience, so when the user clicks, he sees the form finish, and he sees the preview of this thing, and they're not saying download PDF, like when he sees that his form is ready, it should be responsive, so there should be a nice preview for both mobile and android, it should be like instant, when he just reads download, instead of downloading, they will not tell him that, okay, on that same dashboard route, but now it's for guest, that is what I'm trying to figure out how it will work, same thing, my type is slash dashboard, because after his registration now, for the, when, you know, there will not be a pop-up that register to get this document for free, then when I press register, he will just fill his email, fill his password, confirm his password, maybe on the pop-up, right, on the pop-up itself, he will be seeing his document on the pop-up, he may just press create, create account, the account will be created, and it will take him back to the form, then his data will be downloaded, so he will not save it, so the dashboard now, will not be turned to a user dashboard, so now, it will not be like a welcome message, welcome to my site, the dashboard will not transform nicely to the main user, like logged in dashboard, and, okay, from what I don't have experience with all this, so what I'm thinking is that, when that kind of user now, now go back to the .com of my domain, is now sent to the dashboard, but I don't know if that, because then, there's no need to say create for free, since he's already a logged in user, so when he logs out, when he logs out, his session is still on, so let me undo that, let me tell, give the notes on how that will be undone, because imagine now, there's a user that is already logged in, goes to my site, please .com, what will happen, is he seeing the same create document for free, because I don't know, I don't want them to not create document for free again, it's only for their first time that they can do that, and also, create security measures to avoid abuse, I already have a lot of security measures, but I need one that will make sure that a user, maybe a user using a browser or something, cannot register up to two accounts with his phone, even if he changes his browser, cannot register up to, no, no, no, what will happen is that, he can register up to two accounts, but you see that free token, if he goes through the, you know if a user goes through the CTA that he creates a free document, then that means that he's free, that is one free document token is already eaten, so he will eat it, then if the user now wants to not choose to, now wants to choose to, I'm thinking, if the user wants to choose to, choose to log in, log in, that is after he register his account, that document is downloaded, and he can preview the document later, that is, there is no longer free token for him to create a document, so he's already eaten, and for the token system, I'm using something like a code, a code, not cash, I don't want cash, because I might increase the price later, and that cash will be constant, so for now, I'll be using something like, like a code, a coin, maybe, I don't know, the website is my type, it's M-O-Y-T-Y-P-I-S-T, I don't know if it's wise to be using a token, so that, because another thing I'm having problem is that, for the user that registers through the, that free document from the landing page, that is like he's testing it, when he creates his account, after creation of his account, so that the account is created very fast, when he creates his account, and I don't know if it's then he will not see the plans, because they are now plans of pay as you go, that is, it will just be a plan, pay as you go, that is, pay as you go, that will be like the free plan, I don't know if it's after he's landed on his dashboard that he will see that, I don't know, that's what I'm trying to think, then there will be, he will not be able to upgrade there, so he cannot upgrade to enterprise or other levels, and also for normal user that is just registering from the register dot, the register page, that one we have a nice opportunity to even see all the plans and select his plan for the day that he wants, on his registration, what you send, so it's not even up to 40% of what I send to you, read my voice note again, when you answer my question, add the content, understand right out what I said through, that is like, say okay, this is what I want, this is what I want, then before you talk about your advancement inside, so what should happen, instead of, because the system, you are seeing now that the system is supposed to be very robust, so now that when the system detects that, okay this user has used his token for his last account, even if he clears his cookie or his session, even if he clears everything, we will still be able to track him, even if he changes his phone, his browser, you should make a very high backend tracking, that will make sure you can track him, even the server, the server should be able to track him, so, so it's not even detected as fraud or anything, because I don't want the system just chasing my user away, in case a user mistakesly used a new email or gmail, so what happens when a user now like, tries to create an account, when he already has an account in another browser, what will happen is that, he doesn't download it, he just says welcome, then at the background you will not see the document, they will not say pay for the document, so the document will actually be processed and stored, but it should be able to be downloaded, so you just be like, put it in a draft, yes, if you add it to the draft, what the user is going to pay, before it's cleared from the draft, so that draft, and what that draft is actually doing, there is a draft system, I just thought of this new system of the draft, the draft system, immediately the user is creating a document, typing, even if you just type half of his name and leave, that draft will actually be saved, but the document preview of the draft and everything will actually be saved, so the user can actually come later and complete it, and also if the user finishes and he doesn't want to pay now, so he will be having the option that is like, pay now or save as draft, so there is no pressure, because since we are using the token system now for the balance, it will save us in a way that, different, the admin and when uploading, it can just set this token as 500 tokens, 1000 tokens, so the user now, when they want to purchase, so they can actually add, so what will happen is that, they will be able to deposit, yes, they will deposit, so they are not actually, to avoid, this is to avoid payment issues, yes, this, just make sure this system is very improved, because to avoid payment issues and refund issues, where is on generation of the document, user have to now pay or use payment gateway, that payment gateway will not be stressed, it might have a server shutdown because of that, so you actually have to use dashboard, so that wallet system now is very important, so the user will be seeing something like add money on the wallet, that dashboard, so it will be saying add, buy tokens, so the tokens now, is the admin now that will actually put the rate of the token to the value of the payment gateway, that is maybe I can just, on the admin can say that, one token is 10 Naira, 10 token is, once you just put the rate, the admin can just put 100 Naira equal to 1000 token, it will set the minimum purchase of the token, it will set the maximum purchase of the token, you see, and when a user is subscribing for the, when a user is subscribing for, that is, that dashboard, so it will pay as you go user, for user subscribing for a enterprise plan or some plan like that, instead of seeing those tokens, they actually now see something like, document creation remaining, so there is like, it's not token, it's now actually document creation, so when a, I don't know what is done about, make sure it's standard, what is standard, the, how user can go to my route back, if they can go back to my domain route, or if, when they go back to my domain route, is it good for them to be seeing, create document for free, and I need it to be in a way that, even if the user decides to change the user name, like creating document for free, we, as far we know, that is, creates very advanced, and, the digital system that, we are only assigning, we are only assigning free token, or allowing the user to create free token, if that device has not been like, the device has not been detected of, for, on our traffic, or, you know, you know how to do it, use all those professional Facebook, Google, their fraud detection system, all the, and all those free trial stuff, that is what I need your help for, because, I don't want people going back to create free account, free account, free account, with changing their email, I want it, once they create, they can actually create the document to, but, no, they can't create document, so, once a user have registered with that form before, or he actually registered before, even if he log out and try creating a new document, when he try creating a new document, after he fills the form, and he reach the path to going to create that, that document, that path is going to create it, it will, as it first generates, that is the path I need you to undo it, that path there, that path where he is now wanting to register, immediately register, the document is downloaded automatically, since he already uses free token on that device, or, on, related to that, in save before, it will not be filled, that is, it will not display something like, instead of downloading, the dashboard, after the dashboard reloads, it will not say, welcome to this thing, something, you have already used the free trial in another account, before, related to this account, so, accounts will actually be having relationships, so that, if the user, even if the user wants to, like, change his phone, like, change his, change his email, will be able to identify that he is a scum, are you a fool, I'm saying things like, you wrote, on your workflow, you wrote that, when user sign in and pay, he will receive a certain number of token, are you stupid, on pay as you go, how can he receive a certain number of token, the, the user that goes through the registration form, that is the registration form, we actually have a choice where we see different, so, improve this your guy, you have, you have a choice where you see different plans, so, he's the one that will not choose which of the plans he wants, so, if he actually goes for the free plan, then, he won't, he won't receive any token, he just, he won't receive any payment disturbance, so, we just, he may see it's a free plan, that is, it will be like, register for free, something like that, and, make sure that you, there is, you tell, you write on the document, that there is no credit card needed, because, actually, there is no credit card needed, to test first, before they actually put their credit card, so, both, then, if that was a free plan, when the user registers on his dashboard, he will not receive a pop-up, that, there is, welcome, you have a welcome bonus, or certain number of tokens, that is where the admin comes in, so, the admin can set the welcome bonus, so, for the paid user, too, for the user that is using, free, no, for the user, like, going for the business plan, or for the premium plan, or any of the plans, that are actually paid for, monthly, or, sessionally, the admin actually have authority to select, how much each of them receive, that is, it will be, it will be called free trial bonus, so, everybody, everybody have a option of, everybody have a choice to, actually receive a certain number of free tokens, that is why the token system is very important, so, without stress, the admin can just go to the, free token page on his place, and just say, okay, 10 tokens, and free tokens, for any sign-up, both, as far as the sign-up is actually unique, and, there is no trace of that sign-up on that device, before, or to that user, he actually received it, okay, but, even if there is a single trace, the user won't be notified or anything, no, the token will just be that, okay, you didn't receive any token, even if he tries, creating a new document, from that, from that, CTA page, where he tries creating a document, then, he feeds the document, then, let it create for free, then, try registering again, he will just see that the document is on the draft, when he goes to the draft, he will see that there is no free token, that he has used it, so, he is only receiving a pop-up or a notification, when he hasn't used the free token before, so, things like that, you know all these things, so, you are the one that is to advance it, I have not worked with companies in codebase before, so, I don't know how it works, for the payments, too, for all their payments, they don't have to pay on registration, for the free plan, it will just, it will not, it is just like, it is just totally free, then, the number of tokens, if the number of tokens is enough to do a number of documents, that is his choice, so, he can go, he can see the template market, create the number of tokens that he wants, that is how he feeds the free token amount, but, when the user not choose to, okay, I want to add token, so, he will just add token, then, he will go to the payment page, where he will not have to buy token, so, he will not send to the payment gateway, and all that, all that, for the paid user also, for the paid user, what they will just experience is that, for the paid user, what they will experience is that, like, so, subscribe this out, after they are, on their free plan, too, they can use their free plan and test the free document, then, they will not be, they will not be something like, on the dashboard, they need to be like, pay for plan, or something like that, or, or, allow him to use his free token, so, he will not receive notification that, you can use your, you can continue to use your free token, till you are ready to pay, I don't know how you do that, you will work on that, both the, the paid plan, where it's official, and on every, on, after the user pays, they will, he will actually sees it on the, on the dashboard, that expires which date, so, it will show the month, and the year it's expiring, what I'm telling you all these front-end details is that, it's important on using front-end, too, that, you know, what will actually happen for the front-end, eh, no, no, no, please, I need your help on the token management, because, there are three plans, forget about the customer care plan, there is the PRT group, there is enterprise, and there is business, so, those three plans, one is, token business, and the other is like, so, instead of prices on the tokens now, the, the only place concerning the payment, that is the only, eh, the only, eh, route concerning payment now, is just when the user wants to add, wants to buy tokens, and when they want to, when their plan is expiring, and they want to upgrade their plan, so they will see the, the link to upgrade their plan or things like that, so, what I'm pushing for now is that, ok, understand that, I need your help, I need your help on this, even when we don't know the exact amounts now, give the, give the logics, you are, you are, you are to help me to build on logics, because now, we are in the dashboard now, I'm now saying that, three, three users now, three plan users, which are like the pay as you go, they have a, they have a logic of seeing the number of tokens they actually have currently, so, they might go to the add token place and make payment, then when they are typing in the amount they want, so they can actually type the amount, that is, see, there will be like suggestion, which making the minimum deposit, 500, no, no, so the admin can actually set the minimum deposit on the site, and it can actually set how much the ratio of token to cash, when the user selects what they want, that is for the free users or the normal users that they can see add money route, but for the subscribe users, they will, they will only see things like upgrade plan, they will see when they are, on their dashboard there, they will see when their plan is expiring, that is, it might, it might be like, dash on till 5th of July, okay, something like that, next, next payment plan, the 5th of July, there will be payment, where they can put auto-renewal, where they will be auto-debiting with their card, also work on the payment system to make the management like very mad and robust, where we can handle their card very securely, standardly, and be able to like use our payment gateway to take recurring debits, that is what I will be needing help for a lot, for the subscription plan, it is just the amount, so they will just have the amount there, then we are the ones on the admin page to select how much token each of those plans get per month, and on their dashboard, they will actually be seeing the tokens, so when the token expires, they can actually see, no, I can't even make the users, yes, the, the, the paid users, they actually have the option to actually still buy token directly, so they can actually be on subscription plan, which might give them like, for example, maybe their enterprise plan, enterprise plan have 100 tokens, imagine, for example, that 100 tokens, so, maybe, when, when that, maybe we are charging one token per document, so when that 100 token finishes, that is for the month, so for the subscription user, for the month, so if it finishes before the month ends, the user can actually now choose to just buy token instead of, instead of paying, so, instead of renewing the plan, so you can just go to, maybe you just need just 2 documents, might just go there and say, let me just buy 500, 5 tokens, it might just, it can just buy 5 tokens and use, just for what it wants, so you understand, so it should be flexible, so I need you to tell me what I said here and reverse statement.



    For the dashboard, I don't know how we are going to work with you two because I'm lost. Because remember I told you for the dashboard, for the on register, that is for the guest user which is using, which wants to create the document, it would just be like a single creation page, which sees its preview. But for login user, after it registers, it sees the statistics, its token, can go to its tab, so its notification, see its download history and all that.

    So things like that, so you understand. For the dashboard now, I don't know what will be there, but I'm thinking that the user will be seeing options to search, so you know about the project, you know a lot about the project now, so you should actually be bringing improvements and suggestions a lot. I don't know whether we can create a document from there, whether we can search, whether when you click search, whether it goes to like dynamically search for the template market or what, I don't know what I would do there.

    So that's what I need your help for because that page is where the user, this page is where user actually see the option to create the document. The way the user wants to create the document, it's actually now moved to the create route, where the user gets the creation details, then that place will now be saved as draft automatically. Then the user is ready to pay for the document, to debit its token.

    We'll be able to ask to make sure it preview the document before it does it. Also, remember there is batch processing. That batch processing, how it works is that the user can select like five different documents and what the system does, the backend does, is perfectly gather those documents, simplify and truncate the inputs to make them not duplicate.

    So instead of having like 7 or 13 inputs, maybe the ones that are repeating, the system can take all those repeating ones as one. Even if they have different font size, different characters, it's just taking them as a reference, taking one as a reference. So when the user types that single input and sends, all of them are sent to their individual place, their individual formatting, individual styling and everything is downloaded.

    So I don't know how the download process, batch download process will also work. That's why I still need your thinking, mad thinking like a UI UX advanced experience programmer. Also, that's for the document processing and the batch.

    Also for the template market or marketplace, I don't know how that will work. So please, I need your help on that aspect. All these pages, I don't have experience, so I need your help on those aspects too.

    Okay, the next page we are dealing with is performance. The user might see little performance on the dashboard, maybe things like hours saved or document created today or things like that. I don't know, but make sure that the backend is well implemented for that.

    And there will be a performance stack page that will have good reporting and tracking of everything you know is necessary. You are the one, you understand the workflow. You know, we are building backend with FastAPL.

    So that is what you are even thinking about mostly. But I need logic too. One thing I would love is that these are seeing how fast the system works.

    So on creation of documents, you might actually want to tell the user that this document was created in seven seconds. You saved approximately, you can just tell the user, I don't know how you do it, you can just tell the user, you saved like 10 minutes because your document was created in five hours. That is, I don't know how you do it.

    Maybe your document was created in two seconds, saving five minutes of your time, or you have saved 10 minutes of your time today. For batch processing, when there are like many documents, what you do is that, you may see the user, you may see all of them are loaded. When all of them are loaded, so the user sees them individually.

    So you can actually, on the batch processing, after the batch process, all the placeholders have been filled. The user can now preview each type, can see preview. As it's seeing the preview, it doesn't like it.

    It can now choose option to edit that single one, or re-edit the form for all of them. Then what is actually happening there is that, okay, as it's previewing this, okay, okay, it can download. The PDF will be downloaded for that single one.

    It goes to the next one, preview, okay, okay, download. And immediately it press download, it's debiting for that single token now. Remember, debiting for the single token.

    You see, or it can just choose to preview, or where it will just be a slider that you see this one, this one, this one. I say, download all. All the PDF are downloaded one by one, instantly.

    Download, download, download, download, like multiple files. The file names of the PDF should be like nice, or it should be the, take one of the nice placeholder, like if there's a name placeholder in the letter, take it. Or if there's no name, you can just use the name of the document, like acceptance letter, or something like that.

    Make the name nice. I've been talking a lot about user page, so make sure this user page, you do a very good job in the advanced letter improvement tool, because right now we are on the setting page. Setting tab now, we are not just writing all the settings out, all of them.

    These things I'm talking are for mostly front-end, but I'm telling you as you are improving it for the back-end developer, so the back-end developer knows the front-end pages. The setting page now will actually be, actually has different tabs. So the setting, the account settings will be like the page where the user sees, okay, account history, his account debit, his tokens.

    There will be plans and billing where the user can see his transaction history, how many token he bought yesterday, how many token he bought last month, total token bought, total token spent, things like that. There will be notification bill on the dashboard where the user can just see notifications, can see red badge on it. So things like that, things like that.

    Also, security, there will be a security page where the user can set two-factor access and different things, like emailing, like changing the email, changing the password. Also, there will be payment history. You know how settings is, all the routes needed, all the services needed, because we are doing the back-end and we have other account information.

    So this, your prompt, so you are bringing this for everything concerning settings. So know that you are working on everything concerning settings, the bill you do, remember that when user register, it doesn't add this card. So it doesn't add this, it doesn't verify his email.

    Maybe yes, somewhere, I don't know how you go and how you make the user verify his email later. So anytime when user register, the email is the same, so you can make sure there is a system that, okay, when the email is the same, it's actually perfectly when the user goes there and click the email. There might be an expiring date for it too.

    I don't know. I don't know how the industry standard is. So when the user goes there and click it, it's actually verified.

    So his account is verified. Why I need that? So when a user wants to actually pay for anything, when the user wants to start paying, like after he has done, no, not for free user, for paid user, when they want to actually add that card or make any upgrade that plan from free plan, there will be a option telling them that they have to add their email because they need to verify their email. Why? Because there might be same security email, like confirm this receipt of your payment, confirm your payment.

    Since there is also renewal so that they won't, their account will be hacked and they can't access it, things like that. Also improve it, improve it, improve it, because I love what you did. You remember what I said though, user account, search, improve it more, search, both on mobile and android, it goes to the like slash dashboard.

    I don't know if that is standard though. It goes to the same dashboard because that dashboard, if the user was registered, it would be seen in statistics, in the document creation history. But now to make this side very fast, like what we are pushing for is like making creation step like three buttons maximum.

    So it will be, search for the document on another page, select the document, goes to the dashboard page where there will be a nice, now it will just be a nice font, still like same, still like just a page, just saying, just for the document creation the user selected, with dashboard. So you just be asking the user for select your name, type your name, type your input, fill your form, when you fill your form, press generate, popup will now come and there, that same page, it's not leaving the dashboard page, everything is happening there, popup will come at that, okay, create your account, it will just be create your account asap, something like that. So download the document, basically put his name, his address, you press create, then the document is sent, the document is sent to his, the document is downloaded, immediately the registration form popup, look at what is happening, immediately registration form popup, it fills his email and his password, his confirm password, then press register, immediately it loads, the form disappears, the dashboard, go back to the dashboard, the very thing, because we are using react and read, very fast, the document starts downloading, the site, it doesn't reload, it just changes like, it changes to the registered user account, that is login user account, the info will now have the popup that, welcome or things like that, so you understand.

    Okay, stay dealing with user site, we are entering now to the support page, this page, I don't know how you do it though, because the support should be handling both user, on the admin page, you support should be handling both admin support and user support, sorry, sorry, I mean user support and guest support, so for this support page, so I don't know how you do it, because support page should be like a page where the user sees things like, what was the issue, what's happening, how to use it, I don't know whether it should be on the backing or on the admin page where you can add new description, new guide, new instructions, I don't know if it's completely standard or industry standard, that is why I'm telling you another page, this is feedback, which is one of the most important page of this website, because it's a MVP, because I need popups, like regular popups or things, I don't know how they do it for a new website, to tell the user, do you like this app, what's the problem, this, this, so that, so this feedback too, this thing can also be for the guest, because remember the guest are creating dashboard, so under their dashboard, they have that creation dashboard, you may have support too and feedback, you see what I'm talking about man, I don't know how you do that robots, remember support and feedback, very advanced, right now you can look at the algorithms, see improve the logics, the support is, I just remember the support is things, having things like, how to use tickets and feedback and contact us, that's what the support page actually is, I don't know if there might actually be a chat, okay, yes, yes, for the feedback or for the support, I don't know if you're even putting them together, for those, those pages actually, what actually need is that, they should actually be like tickets answering a protocol, for the login user, but for the non-login user, we might have, we might have them added that image, so that we send them a ticket ID, yes, a ticket ID, that will be trackable even without logging in, so think about that, think about that and improve the logic on it, so that when, even if it's not our user and he has a support or a feedback, we send him, on creation, we send him a tracking ID, because the admin can actually go reply to that support and feedback, then user, on reply, the user will actually receive a new email that's gonna check info on your ticket and user will actually be able to copy ticket ID, goes to the ticket page, both on landing, on landing, that is a non-login user, then just paste it there and he sees his ticket, while for the login user, for the login user, their tickets will be like a chart, a chart, so they will actually have open tickets, closed tickets and relevant tickets, things like that, that they can chart, chart that, okay, I have this problem, I have this problem, I have this problem, things like that, just think about more logic on it and there's a logout page, logout button, I don't know what that, that will do, it doesn't feel standard, so that's what I just want to tell you, okay, about and that, you can see now we have our, I've told you about my dashboard, performance tab, a document creation page, we have our setting page, we have the ad token, we have the payment and what I did that ad token for is because I want the payment gift to actually be sent only when the user wants to renew his subscription or pay for his subscription or create his subscription or buy token, I don't want them paying for each document they want to create, you see that, so my tracking of my transaction will be actually easier on the admin, apart from that, you can see we have some pages that we have not talked about which I need you to actually think about yourself, that is like the signup page, login page, remember I said that the signup, the emailing is not strict that the user must verify his email to make things ASAP, so even there, there will actually be no credit, no debit credit required, they will just select their plans, then their dashboard and their website will be customized to their plans, that's it, there will be login, there will be forget password, that is reset password page and other things, the contact us and some of those other pages are static pages, we can make them dynamic too, can make them dynamic, like I actually would love if the website made very dynamic, so the admin have a lot of power, like yes, there is a page called the blogs, the blogs page, it's actually a landing page, a static landing page, which is the blog page, that blog page, I need the admin able to post that, this is what we do, this is the, there is like a blog, an advanced blog post, so there are the posts that the static users are seeing or the guest users, actually from the admin, so things like that, even the page is like help center, so make sure that the help center is that support page for the guest, there is a become a partner page, become a partner page, there are lega, there is contact us, there is about my therapies, things like that, most of them, I don't know, you can decide if they are static or dynamic, but for the become a partner page, I would suggest that there is handling, you add handling for that, that can handle the submission of that page, so I need your help too, I should also think about some pages that have not been handled, so the frequently asked questions, yeah, there should be admin page for that, frequently asked questions, that you can add the question and the answer, so that the fronting will be easily edited, make sure that page, make sure that page, and remember these are for the users, so I'm not even entering the admin, so I think the bonuses, feedback, ticket, I think that's all for the users, we actually have done, but now I need you to like, think more, that this project doesn't have, or the documentation this project doesn't have, and add it for me, so I know that is all for the users for now, before we go to the next page, the next page we are going to is the admin page.

    [9/2, 5:39 PM] Meta AI: I'd be happy to help you improve and refine your project idea. Based on what you've shared so far, here are some suggestions and ideas to consider:

Project Overview
- Consider adding a tagline or a brief description to capture the essence of your project. For example, "MyTypeist: Effortless document generation with customizable templates."
- You may want to explore different business models, such as subscription-based or pay-per-use, to generate revenue.

User Experience
- To reduce redundant input fields, you could implement a feature that allows users to save their frequently used information, such as names and addresses.
- For the live preview feature, you could use a combination of frontend and backend technologies to generate a preview of the document as the user inputs their data.
- Consider adding a feature that allows users to save their progress and come back to it later, in case they need to pause and resume their document generation process.

Security and Protection
- To protect the generated documents from being downloaded or stolen, you could implement a watermarking system that adds a visible or invisible watermark to the document.
- Consider using a secure payment gateway to handle transactions and protect user data.

Technical Implementation
- For the document generation process, you may want to explore using a templating engine that can handle complex document structures and formatting.
- Consider using a robust database system that can handle large amounts of user data and document templates.

Additional Features
- You could consider adding features that allow users to collaborate on document generation, or to share their documents with others.
- Consider integrating your platform with popular productivity tools, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, to enhance user experience.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. I'm excited to hear more about your project and provide further suggestions and

[9/3, 7:44 AM] Meta AI: To summarize, you want to implement a feature that allows users to share a preview link of a document with others, and after previewing, the recipient can choose to purchase the document using tokens. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

*Sharing a Document Preview:*

1. *Generate a secret link*: When a user wants to share a document preview, generate a unique, secret link that allows the recipient to view the document.
2. *Set expiration time*: Allow the user to set an expiration time for the link, e.g., 5 hours.
3. *View-only version*: The shared link should display a view-only version of the document, without allowing the recipient to edit or make changes.

*After Previewing:*

1. *Option to purchase*: After previewing the document, the recipient should have the option to purchase the document using tokens.
2. *Download link*: If the recipient purchases the document, provide a download link for the PDF version of the document.
3. *Sharing the download link*: Allow the user to share the download link with others, enabling them to download the PDF document.

*Improvement Suggestions:*

1. *Add a message or comment section*: Allow the user to add a message or comment when sharing the preview link, enabling the recipient to understand the context or provide feedback.
2. *Track preview and purchase history*: Keep a record of who has previewed and purchased the document, enabling the user to track engagement and sales.
3. *Set password protection*: Consider adding password protection to the shared link, ensuring only authorized recipients can access the document preview.
4. *Limit download link usage*: Allow the user to set limitations on the download link, such as the number of times it can be used or the duration it's valid.

By implementing these features and suggestions, you can create a seamless document sharing and purchasing experience for your users.

4. *Security*: The link should be password-protected, with an auto-generated password that expires after a set time (e.g., 5 hours).
5. *Private document*: After the preview expires, the document becomes private, and the link is no longer accessible.

*Form for Setting Preview Link:*

1. *Set expiration time*: The user can set the expiration time for the preview link.
2. *Auto-generated password*: The system generates a password for the preview link.
3. *Display link and password*: After setting the preview link, the system displays the link and password to the user.

*Logic for Preview Link:*

1. *Preview link is active*: The preview link is active until it expires or the document is downloaded.
2. *Recipient can provide feedback*: The recipient can provide feedback on the document during the preview session.
3. *Admin can track engagement*: The user sharing the link can track when the document is viewed and how many times it has been viewed.

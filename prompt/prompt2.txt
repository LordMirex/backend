 you see you see i love what you did here you see this this user this user experience that you talked about allowing allowing feature for autosave their inputs frequently so they can get suggestions when typing that is very important because you see they they are typing their name every time every time you see just that suggestion it made now it just like boost my user experience by 10 percent you see those are things i need so right now let me give you a brief on it on the on the website so let me start on the landing page so user lands on the landing page with the with what my assistant told me he said that it should be easy it should boost our conversion a lot that landing page so we added the feature on the landing page that make make user to like see it's something like generate a your document for free right now i was thinking of having i don't know if it's wise to just put my all my templates there or i just put my um i just put a search bar there or something or popularly generated documents well what we are pushing for that is without on landing guests should be able to like generate a document because here's the here's the trick each user that register like a good direct registration when they register they get a pop-up saying that they have one document creation for free but you see the trick now if there are someone that use city that landing page to register that is that free document is what they are not using so on the city you to be trades document for free so they will know it's for free then when they enter so when they um select the document how to create that you can actually preview the template phase that's one that thing that is not on the website now i need it should be wise if they can preview a format of what they want before they can create it to be like the raw format so when admin so so you have to oh this is what i'm saying there to make sure in any chart you are improving your memory on the project because at the end you'll be giving me large text content on each aspect right now i've got an idea that on the admin now they should be able to upload both the template that will be extracted and the original template that will be displayed as the display as the canvas preview canvas of the document so you users can just read that so it might be like a standard document with text with a test name a test subject name that will be around the website so it might be my name since i'm the admin so something like that so what am i pushing for now is that for the landing this we are just on the landing now for the landing so after this talk you actually generate mad is mad enhancement on each aspect of the landing to the creation for a new landing user so if a landing user just come to the landing page sees okay you after you have to love like tell me how they will be able to generate the documents they might search or anything when they do generate documents their feed are formed they actually see the preview they're like wow it was nice they were depressed download download document it'll be a pdf so it'll just be download pdf something like that all the downloads will be on pdf for it will just be a button download pdf it will make our extraction faster so when user goes to that immediately after that it will not um i don't know how you do it to how you tell the engineer because this code it might also go for the front-end engineer so when do tips so because we'll be documenting what the front-end engineer should do too so what happens is that you actually now say register or login no it will be registered so it's a new user so okay register to download documents so when you press press register it goes to the registration page also keeping in mind that that form that document you have created so he's not wasting also after he's done with the registration the download will start so when he's on his landing page he will just see the download added to his history there to be on his download and document history so we not maybe you might see a pop-up you will not see a pop-up of create a new document now so you should know about the workflow now that workflow of that user now is from document creation on landing so his workflow now he's not saying on landing on logging or registration now he's not saying download cannot download documents congrats cannot download documents something like that they take downloads and download the next document want to download there's no free again he has to not pay while for for users that are ready like him now that he registered through that means for other users that didn't register through that means they go to the landing page like my husband's register they will see that registration form land then they will see a pop-up that is like you got one free document to test or something one free document so that's it

 i know there are lots of improvement that need to be made and lots of undefined routes (alot of pages and feautures that i dont even know thats why i really need your help in researching and creating and making them work) but i thought of some new plans that i want to implemented, i will attach the enhancements so you go through them properly and apply improvementss even better even improving them xthings. Ok, I will start with the admin dashboard. There will be a lot of statistics.

    A lot of statistics. Our earnings, our customers, our users. And that is another important aspect of the website.

    I need statistics to be taken. Not by external support right now. Eternally.

    Guys, good statistics system. Checking visits. Checking the time per visit.

    Checking the average visits. Checking the visits on each page. That's what I also want.

    Guys, checking which page is receiving the highest visits. The statistics page on the admin will actually contain a lot of data. A lot of things.

    You have to think about this logically. There will be reviews. The admin can upload the new document.

    On upload of that document, admin needs to upload. On upload of a document, admin can just immediately the document is uploaded. It will be taken to the modifier or edit page.

    Which will be now the sign-in auditing of that document before it is uploaded. The first form that the admin will see. Let me see.

    A pop-up. Yes, when the admin first uploads the document, it will be a pop-up. It will be a form.

    In a modifier. The admin just uploads the doc file. Put the title of the document.

    Put the short description. Put tags. This is another important part.

    Tags. Groups. Categories.

    I don't know how to do it. For scaling, I need you to think about how those things can help scaling for a long while. Later, I imagine for students.

    So that students can just categorize education or things like that. I don't know if there will be an enum or the admin can define tags. After that.

    Maybe after the form has been seen. The image has been uploaded. The first upload is taken to the page.

    To the full page. Where the admin can modify it. You will see the preview of what it has to look like.

    When users put it. There is one important part. Remember I said that there might be two addresses in the letter.

    One might be the top. One might be the down. That one might be up.

    We have nine bricks on each side. When the user sees the input. He will just see one address.

    He types his address. Put comma. Continue.

    On each comma. For the sender address on a formal letter. You know that.

    It actually breaks. For a formal letter, it actually breaks. But the letter in the body is just the street.

    So since we can't actually identify which one is the body or the header. Since the user is sending one. What to actually do.

    Is that. We allow the admin. Able to come down.

    And select predefined. Functions or things. That is why I need the help on logic.

    So the admin can just search. Search something there. For the.

    Specific cause. Each of the. Placeholders can be individual.

    But for the user side. Each of the placeholders that are similar. Or the same name.

    Can be grouped. They are arranged. According to the order of the scandal.

    Even when they are grouped. They are also systematically arranged. So for things like.

    If there are multiple names. The user just types a single name. And.

    If the admin sets. Like the font size. Or the.

    Output size. Or the. Formatting.

    Or the. Like. The date type.

    If he types. Format. Things like that.

    You understand. Okay. There will be.

    Template management system. Like. After the user.

    The admin. Completed. And press.

    Send. It can go to. The template management system.

    Where you can view. All the posts. All the.

    These things. Edit them. Change the.

    Audience. Actually. Preview them.

    See their. Statistics. See how.

    How much they have made. Things like that. And.

    They are not. Buying the template. They are actually.

    Paying to use. Each one. So they are spending.

    Token to use. Each one. So the admin can.

    There is one good fact. That I'm thinking. That the admin can.

    Just. Type. So.

    You don't have to be. Putting. Each amount.

    For each. Template. When.

    There is an. Updating price. The admin.

    There will be. Something. The option.

    That the admin can just put. 50. 50 token.

    Maybe you want to increase. All the documents. By 50 tokens.

    You want to. Reduce all the documents. By 50 tokens.

    So there will be a bulk. Reduction. Maybe.

    For all the documents. In the database. Or for.

    All the. Templates. Of a specific group.

    Or tag. Things like that. So you are the one.

    That can have. And there will be. Mad.

    User management. So the admin can. View.

    Delete. Suspend. And.

    Give the user. A plan. Blog user.

    Monitor the user. Statistics. And all that.

    He can. The next part. To be doing.

    But before. I do that next part. You.

    Yourself. With the website. Information.

    Tell me more. Things that you know. Will be needed.

    For the admin. Because we are moving to. Moderator next.

    So on the. User management. The admin can create.

    A moderator account. For things like. Feedbacks.

    But. First. Think about it.

    Now. I was thinking that. I guess.

    I have. A. Employee or something. That.

    Will be the moderator. So. The admin.

    Is to actually. Is not to edit. A user account.

    To a moderator. Is actually now. A moderator.

    Is now. Creating a user. So it will be.

    On the admin page. Create. A user.

    There will be only one admin. To the website. I don't know.

    If that is smart. I don't know. If that is smart.

    Because the admin. Is created by the. Database query.

    On build. When you are creating. The system.

    But I don't know. If it will be nice. To have soup.

    Because. I need. To be secure.

    Very secure. Then. For the.

    Moderator. I don't know. If it possible.

    I can just. Create a. Moderator table. From the.

    Guys. I need your. Implementation.

    Guide. Because. What you are telling me.

    Is also. Actually build. Just make sure.

    It's standard. So right now. I'll work on the moderator.

    And what the moderator. Does. How is.

    Frontend is. Because. It's still landing.

    On the dashboard. It's working. As a user.

    The admin too. It's still landing. On the dashboard.

    But it's now. As the admin. Okay.

    Now. Let's do the. Moderator.

    Moderator is like. The second. Level rule.

    After the admin. Yeah. Before the user.

    Before they get. To the moderator. By default.

    There is no. Moderator account. Created.

    Oh yeah. They will. Build it.

    In a way that. On development. A moderator account.

    Will be created. Moderator account. Should not have.

    All the permissions. Like. Viewing the.

    Earnings. Or. Create topics.

    It should just be like. Use. Copy this.

    Standard. Moderator account. That.

    Can be a staff. Something like that. To work on it.

    Also. Remember. To add the.

    Logics. For the. Dashboard.

    Add user. Dashboard. So be it.

    Because. Now. That user.

    Dashboard. Is collecting. Both the admin.

    The. Moderator. The user.

    The guest. On the guest. That.

    That guest. Owns. Where.

    The user. Where. The passengers.

    Access the document. Remember. Are you foolish.

    You forget. That guest. Dashboard.

    Have the option. To. Create a document.

    They have options. To create documents. That is.

    When they are creating documents. For free. That is the only time.

    They have access to the. Dashboard. When they.

    They select the document. They want to create on landing. And create documents.

    For the sharing. I mean. I don't really.

    Understand the logic. So. Bring down the logic.

    For the sharing. Because. I found.

    I'm planning on something like. Yes. Something is nice.

    Something. I just thought of. Like.

    A document that is on the draft. You can just. Add.

    Something. A button like. Share to.

    Another person. For preview. So that.

    Another person can preview. The progress. Maybe.

    You are doing the work. For another person. The person will preview.

    The document. So it will be. A secret link.

    So. It will just be. Optional.

    That is like. It will be. It will be accessible.

    For the next. Five hours. Or something like that.

    Or the user. Or the admin. Or the user can.

    Select it. So. And you press.

    Share. Share document. That sharing of the document.

    So. It's just a view only. Version.

    That only that user. Only. That user can get.

    The link. So. To generate.

    A link. That user can now share. Share out.

    That is. A preview link. That is like.

    Another of the guest. Functions. So when.

    You click the link. That is a guest. You just.

    You just load. On the. Dashboard.

    That is. You just see the document. Can read the document.

    But you cannot. Actually. Type anything.

    You can just read. You can just read. The document.


    The desktop. So. So.

    So. So. So.

    they will just say that I love what you did there but the name is not consistent, something like that. So, immediately they send it, it's like it disappears, no other person can see the history on the preview. The only thing they see is the admin message at first.

    The admin now that will not be seeing the previews, they will not see the preview, okay look at what the person said, so something like that. And for the tracking, yes, to track it is nice, so the admin should actually see when the document is viewed, how many times it has been viewed, and there should be security so it should have the password, so there will be an auto-generated password for each of the previews. That, immediately five hours collapse, the preview stops, so it becomes a private document, nobody, no other person can preview the document, and the admin, and the password destroys everything.

    So when the admin first, so the option that, where is the option to like, P, after it previews it, that is where you cannot see share for audit, share for audit or preview to others. That part, when they do it, there will be a password to generate it, no, it will be a form first where you can say, okay, how long do you want this to be open, the maximum should be about, I don't know, you think about those logic, but I think there should be auto-generated password so that, after it's done, the password and the link will not be pop-up that is like, this is your preview link, copy it and share it, to expire the next five hours, and here is the password, share with the audit. So, something like that.

    Well, I need additional suggestions on fully on, you understand the project, fully on features that you think that are important or that will be profitable, that have not added. Imagine that there are many things that have not added, and you are not even seeing it. Nice, nice, let me take out the ones that I want here.

    I want that version of Contra, I like it. Anyone taking it, you have to now improve it and give the logic on how the backend developer is going to do it, so I'll send it to him. I love the version Contra, so the user can actually track the changes, even if you go back and edit some things on the document, you actually can see the older versions.

    I don't know how you can do it, so think about that and do it. The document template, yeah, that is the main purpose of the website, the admin creates the document template, and it works. Number four, I don't want number four.

    I don't want anybody to create custom workflow, it's too advanced. I don't want integrations with other tools, but they can share, they can actually share the PDF directly to the IGMA, but it's not integrated by us. Advanced stage, yes, that is one thing that I need.

    Work on that part very well. Work on boosting our SEO in a way that each document is like a single guest page. You see, you know there is a preview.

    There is a preview for a document that is under preview for creation. There will be a single page for each document, like each template that they have posted, that will have a preview. And remember, I said that that preview document or the preview image is actually the image that the admin uploads.

    So the admin upload has the option of putting the preview image and the actual Plissuda document that will be extracted, or it will be two options, the preview document and the extraction document. The extraction document is the one that the Python is working with, but the preview is the one that users will see. Now I'm saying that outside, like someone can just search for invoice data on Google and see our document.

    They can click it. They can observe it. Okay, I like this.

    I like this. I can bring two. Work on how we can boost our SEO and engagement also for socials, so that when someone just sends the link on a platform like WhatsApp, they can see the image of the document and the short description and the title, just like that.

    And when they enter, they think they are like a guest user. For guest users, when they enter, they cannot see like create documents for free. Maybe it's not like a SEO tool.

    Now go to that dashboard where they create the document, and they have to register. But if they already registered, when they click that link, they just take it to that dashboard, and it's on create a route. So they just create the document, pay for the toolkit, or preview, just like that.

    That's for the advanced stage. So for the admin side, are there like robust keyword placement, metadata, the content, the keywords, the tags, because that will help search. I'm maybe thinking of able to know each of the words on the document so that if users are just searching for something, the words on the document might actually be linking and relating to the advanced search.

    The security, yes, there's already security and compliance. The platform, that will be done by the front end, so leave that one. For that probability part, I don't understand the part.

    I don't want, there's already sufficient base. There is pay-as-you-go, there is business, there is enterprise. I don't want the document marketplace yet.

    I just want a template, like a document template. That would be like, it's just a listing of the documents that the admin posted. Then they might be categorized by, okay, maybe a user, because users can also upload their documents.

    Remember, when a user uploads their document, the document is not already prepared. It's the one that will now tell the computer that, okay, look at the name I want to extract. As it's typing, since the system has already scanned all the words inside, before you type it, it can auto-complete or make sure that the key and the value is exact, because the key now is the word that is on the document.

    If there are multiple, the user can pay multiples together. That is nicely. Then the value will now be the placeholder name.

    On creation, it actually tells the user to wait for admin preview. If you wait for five minutes before the document is added to private document. On creation, you can actually have options to say, okay, make this document private or make it public.

    It's your choice. Making it private is just so nobody can access it, but making it public, it will add it to the template market under the section of users templates. It will be like the marketplace, but now it's not free.

    You are just adding it. The admin now is the one that will set the amount for each user template. Templates that users send.

    The admin has a lot of permissions to set the token amount. A template like the one that users make public, it can just assign, okay, this number of tokens to it. Once it's posted, it can assign, okay, this number of tokens.

    It might choose that all the educational tag documents, it can add this number of tokens. It can change all of them to this number of tokens. Very advanced pricing techniques for the token.

    Also, for the advertisement, to work on the admin page, I have not done advertisement before. I don't know how it will work. Work on the admin page.

    It should be robust. Think about different advertisement strategies and how we can implement it for the project. Good ones that will be related to documents that we can add on our site.

    The partnership, that partnership, that's our partner. We can then advertise. Work on the advertisement because the admin page will now be able to see the partner's request and see their message.

    You can actually get their data and now post. The data insight. That part, I was about to say anonymous data insight.

    That part is really important because how can we say we don't know how to extract it? Make sure the backend now is making every data entry and leaving the website very much extracted. That is like you are storing them somewhere. Data should be enough data on the website.

    Visits per day. Documents saved. Time processed.

    Everything. We need data on everything. The statistics and performance ratio now is like I need to boost it like times 100 because the admin now, on the admin page, there should be a page where you can access that part.

    My data insight. We can just say, okay, this is how the users have been logging in. This is where they log in past.

    This is the time they spend. Because there now, that data insight will now be a page where all the performance page or statistics page will now be a page where you have not added it before. There will be like extraction.

    You can extract. I don't know if it's CSV or PDF or anything. And they can download it in different formats.

    Like PDF, anything. So they can extract the data. And also, you can tell the backend should be getting enough data so that it can be represented in various style like in graphs or in pie charts or different ways to make sure that data is gotten properly.
